# BCD-vision
This repository proposes pytorch code to train a convolutional model on MNIST or FMNIST with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Block Coordinate Descent (BCD). It aims to show the different behaviours of the training related to the schochaticity and the number of parameters we update per batch.
